# NeuralNetworks-MiniProject3
NeuralNetworks-MiniProject3
Second mini project of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course instructed by Dr.Kalhor,School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran
Following Topics have been covered in this project
* Vibrational Auto Encoders 
  In this question both vae and conditional-vae are developed to generate MNIST characters.
* Conditional GAN
  In this question a conditional generative adverserial networks is trained to generate pictures conditioned on label. Fashion MNIST is used for the training phase 
 * Cycle GAN
  First of all Cycle GAN architecture is studied completely and then this network is implemented using monet2photo dataset
